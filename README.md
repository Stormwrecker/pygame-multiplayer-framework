UPDATE May 2024: I found out that this format does NOT support images, so you'd be stuck with a dumb square as your player. Fix is on its way soon.

This code is adapted from a series that TechWithTim made, but I made it expanable and can have up to 4 clients. So far, this framework has proved to be pretty indestructible. The only error you might get is if you try to open too many clients. Hopefully, it's generic enough to implement it in whatever Pygame project you have.

Below is a preview of 4 clients interacting with each other:

Cool, right?
