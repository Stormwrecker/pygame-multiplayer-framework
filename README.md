This code is adapted from a series that TechWithTim made, but I made it expanable and can have up to 4 clients. It is fairly stable and has no known bugs, but there are probably a few things that may come up later on. Hopefully, it's generic enough to implement it in whatever Pygame project you have.

Below is a preview of 4 clients interacting with each other:

Cool, right?
